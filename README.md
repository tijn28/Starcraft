## StarCraft: Brood War in Multi-Agent Systems

Travis CI: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/eishub/Starcraft.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/eishub/Starcraft)

This project creates a bridge between [BWAPI](https://code.google.com/p/bwapi/ "BWAPI") for [StarCraft: Brood War](http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/games/sc/ "StarCraft: Brood War") and EIS-enabled Multi-Agent Systems like the [GOAL Agent Programming Language](https://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki/ "GOAL Agent Programming Language").

The environment interface standard ([EIS](https://github.com/eishub/eis/wiki "EIS")) has been developed to facilitate connecting software agents to environments.

For more information please see the [Wiki](https://github.com/eishub/Starcraft/wiki "Wiki") and/or the [Manual](https://github.com/eishub/Starcraft/blob/master/doc/Resources/StarCraft%20Environment%20Manual.pdf "StarCraft Environment Manual").
